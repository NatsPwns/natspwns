## Hi 👋! 

> Cybersecurity specialist with a forensic VM, and a suspicious amount of gel pens. I reverse, question, and paint things.

## 🧠 Who I Am

I hold a Master’s in Cybersecurity and a background in IT, currently working in Tech Support while developing dangerously advanced Google search skills and sharpening my digital forensics claws. I specialize in asking uncomfortable questions (to systems *and* people), and I’m a bit obsessed with OSINT, privacy, and a knack for breaking things to improve them.

- 🕵️ OSINT, DFIR, privacy and social engineering aficionada
- 🎨 Part-time digital investigator, part-time barista, full-time overthinker
- 🧰 IT-trained, tech support hardened
- 🕸️ Professional stalker (They call it OSINT)
---
## 🧰 Toolbox

- **Languages:** Bash, HTML/CSS — dabbling in R and Go  
- **Security & DFIR:** Autopsy, Volatility, Wireshark, CyberChef, Sysinternals, YARA, Sigma, grep-fu  
- **Automation & Scripting:** Python for triage/reporting, PowerShell sorcery, CLI-all-the-things philosophy  
- **Ops & Support:** GSuite Admin, M365 Admin, Okta, OAuth/API debugging, log spelunking  
- **Investigation & OSINT:** Obsidian, EXIF tools, Google dorking (Olympic level), Archive.org dives, social graphing  
- **Docs & Productivity:** Git, Markdown, suspiciously aesthetic spreadsheets  
- **Vibes:** Elegant, useful, slightly feral — but thoroughly documented

## 📚 Currently Learning

- 🧪 Advanced forensic analysis (because sleep is for the weak)
- Russian (for OSINT, drama, and brain pain)
- 📜 Studying for the [OSIP](https://inteltechniques.com/training-osip.html) training for elite stalking with certification
- 🧘 How to rest without guilt (send tips)

## 🖤 Things I Love

- DFIR puzzles and cursed Excel files
- Coffee-fueled deep dives that start with “just checking one log” 
- Making elegant diagrams out of horrifying architecture  
- K-Dramas with powerful women and emotionally unavailable CEOs
- Turning chaotic source material into suspiciously polished docs

## ✨ Bonus Lore

- 🎓 I hold **four degrees** — only two are techy (the others? Choose your own adventure)
- 🍰 I'm a classically trained **pastry chef** — I can craft exploit chains *and* mille-feuille
- 📚 I’ve been reading since age 3; currently in a literary burnout because adult life replaced fiction with PDFs
- 🐶 **Oliver** is my Threat Detection Unit, emotional support, and part-time Zoom disruptor
- 🎨 I paint when I’m not dissecting registry keys or Googling Unicode obfuscation tricks
